# Tower-Defense-Game
A real time top-down two player game.  The goal of this game is to try and destroy your opponent's main tower before he destroys yours.  Each player has a certain number of resources given to them, they can use those resources to build buildings to stop the opponent from attacking their tower.  Game ends once one of the player's tower is destroyed.

This was a project made in my Computer Science 309 class with a group of 3 other people.  We had to design a fully functioning Adroid application that incudes a frontend(client) side, backend(server) side, and a database and have all three components talk to each other to make the application functional.  We made out whole project using only Java.  For the client side we used Android Studio, for the server side we used SpringBoot, and for out database we use MySQL Database.

I was mainly responsible for the fronted code and most of the database queries.  Most of the frontend code, about 70% was written by me, and the rest of it was written by the rest of my team members.  I also worked a little bit on the server side, but that wasn't my main part of the project.
